## Challenge: Building Your DeFi Empire

Welcome to Avalanche Subnets, where you embark on a journey to build your own decentralized finance (DeFi) empire! In this tutorial, you'll learn how to set up your very own EVM subnet on Avalanche, laying the foundation for your DeFi Kingdom clone. We'll guide you through creating and deploying a custom subnet, along with essential smart contracts like ERC20 token contracts and Vault contracts. These steps will enable you to dive into the world of decentralized finance, taking your first strides towards constructing a thriving DeFi empire. Let's begin!

## Getting Started

Before diving into the intricacies of DeFi, it's essential to set up your environment correctly. Here's a high-level overview of the steps you'll take:

1. **Set Up Your EVM Subnet**: Utilize our guide and the Avalanche documentation to create a custom EVM subnet on the Avalanche network.

2. **Define Your Native Currency**: Establish your native currency, which will serve as the in-game currency for your DeFi Kingdom clone.

3. **Connect to Metamask**: Connect your EVM Subnet to MetaMask, facilitating seamless interaction with your deployed contracts. Follow the steps outlined in our guide for a smooth integration.

4. **Deploy Basic Building Blocks**: Utilize Solidity and Remix to deploy fundamental smart contracts for your game, including contracts for battling, exploring, and trading. These contracts will define essential game rules such as liquidity pools, tokens, and more.

## Note

While it's crucial to understand the workings of DeFi and how to generate value for users, this tutorial focuses primarily on setting up an EVM subnet on Avalanche and deploying foundational smart contracts for building a DeFi Kingdom clone. For a deeper understanding of DeFi mechanics and user value generation, additional resources may be required.
